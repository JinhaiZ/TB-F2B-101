# Topology of Distributed System

3 things need to be considered in Distributed System
 
 - no centrelized clock synchronization system, and network is not ideal, time delay is introduced, so synchronise multipy machine to work together is difficult.
 - 2 work mode: synchro mode -> ideal asynchro mode -> real world
 - system failure is oftern, strategy to solve it ? -> timeout
